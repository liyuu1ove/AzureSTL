# AzureSTL
Im learning cpp and i would like to improve my proficiency and understanding of cpp by writing my own template. 

Every question and pull request are welcomed!

But im not familiar with CMake or GNU Make so it may look kinda of crude.Anyways it is just a personal demo. Please help me to improve it!
